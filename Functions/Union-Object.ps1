    Notes from the web page:
    Union-Object
    Most native PowerShell cmdlets that handle an array of objects (like e.g. Export-CSV) only look to the first object to define the concerned properties. This behavior can lead to unexpected results. Consider the following object:

    $List = @(
        New-Object PSObject -Property @{Id = 2}
        New-Object PSObject -Property @{Id = 1}
        New-Object PSObject -Property @{Id = 3; Name = "Test"}
    )

    If you simply display this object array, only the Id property will be listed:

    PS C:\> $List

    Id
    --
     2
     1
     3
    You might quickly fix this by aligning the properties of the first object with the rest of the objects (Name = $Null):

    $List = @(
        New-Object PSObject -Property @{Id = 2; Name = $Null}
        New-Object PSObject -Property @{Id = 1}
        New-Object PSObject -Property @{Id = 3; Name = "Test"}
    )
    This will work for most of the cases:

    PS C:\> $List

    Id Name
    -- ----
     2
     1
     3 Test
    But not in every case:

    PS C:\> $List | Sort Id

    Id
    --
     1
     2
     3
    In other words, it is required to align every object in the array to prevent that you lose any properties. The quickest way is to use the Select-Object cmdlet: Select-Object Id, Name, knowing that just selecting all objects: Select-Object *, doesnâ€™t resolve the issue. This mean that it is still required to iterate through all the objects to define all the properties.

    Fixed array example:
    $List = @(
        New-Object PSObject -Property @{Id = 2}
        New-Object PSObject -Property @{Id = 1}
        New-Object PSObject -Property @{Id = 3; Name = "Test"}
    )

    $NewList = $List | Union-Object

    $NewList

    Id Name
    -- ----
     2
     1
     3 Test

    $Objects = $Input | ForEach {$_}
    If (!$Property) {
        ForEach ($Object in $Objects) {
            $Property += $Object.PSObject.Properties | Select -Expand Name
        }
    }
    $Objects | Select ([String[]]($Property | Select -Unique))
