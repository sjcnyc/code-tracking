#Create a new repository on GitHub. You'll import your external Git repository to this new repository.
#On the command line, make a "bare" clone of the repository using the external clone URL. This creates a full copy of the data, but without a working directory #for editing files, and ensures a clean, fresh export of all the old data.

$ git clone --bare https://external-host.com/extuser/repo.git

# Makes a bare clone of the external repository in a local directory
#Push the locally cloned repository to GitHub using the "mirror" option, which ensures that all references, such as branches and tags, are copied to the #imported repository.

$ cd repo.git
$ git push --mirror https://github.com/ghuser/repo.git

# Pushes the mirror to the new GitHub repository
#Remove the temporary local repository.

$ cd ..
$ rm -rf repo.git
